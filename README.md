**Industrial Classification of Workforce in India**

_Overview_

This project aims to update the information on the industrial classification of main and marginal workers in India, excluding cultivators and agricultural laborers. The classification is done by sex and by section, division, and class to provide accurate data for policy-making and employment planning. The project includes merging and cleaning datasets, performing data exploration and analysis, feature engineering, model building, and testing. Additionally, natural language processing techniques are used to analyze core industries and group business categories such as retail, poultry, agriculture, and manufacturing.

**Approach**

1. Data Collection and Merging: Multiple CSV data files are merged to create a comprehensive dataframe.
2. Data Exploration: Understanding the structure and characteristics of the dataset, identifying missing values.
3. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the data.
4. Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones.
5. Data Analysis and Visualization : In the project, data analysis and visualization involve examining collected data to understand workforce distribution across industries and regions in India through charts and graphs.

**Files Included**

notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing code for data preprocessing, analysis, and model development.

app: Source code for the Streamlit dashboard application.

**Results**

Developed a dashboard app using Streamlit and Plotly to visualize the distribution of workers across various industries and geographies.
Analyzed and categorized business sectors using natural language processing techniques.
Provided relevant facts and figures to address the business problem and support decision-making.
